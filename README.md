 Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning
Technologies: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Built a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification model achieving 78% accuracy in predicting diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. Conducted thorough EDA, applied feature scaling, and visualized model performance through confusion matrices and ROC curves. Optimized the model to attain a precision of 80% for non-diabetic and 71% for diabetic classes, demonstrating strong and balanced predictive capability.
