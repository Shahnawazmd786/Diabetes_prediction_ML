 Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning
Technologies: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Developed and deployed a machine learning model to predict diabetes outcomes with 78% accuracy using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. Performed extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and feature engineering to optimize model performance. Trained and compared multiple classification algorithms, evaluated results using confusion matrices and ROC curves, and applied hyperparameter tuning to enhance prediction robustness.
